            <li>500 g spaghetti</li>
            <li>100 g bacon (Ideally streaky bacon)</li>
            <li>200 g Pecorino (or any parmesan)</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, oregano</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Large frying pan with lid</li>
            <li>Medium/Large pot</li>
            <li>Medium/Large pasta strainer</li>
            <li>Some small/medium bowls</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Cut the bacon into small cubes. Grate the parmesan, preferably finely. 
                Crack the eggs, but put egg white and york into different bowls.
                <br>
                You can put 1-2 tablespoons of egg white in the bowl with the york.
                <br>
                You will not need the rest of the egg white for this recipe. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Fill the pot with water and a great bit of salt. Heat until it boils.  
                <br>
                While you wait, put the bacon and a small splash of water into the frying pan and heat on low - medium temperature.
                <br>
                Put a lid on top of the pan.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Put the parmesan into the bowl with egg york. Whisk until a continuous paste is created. 
                <br>
                If it does not result in a paste, you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add another egg york, if too firm</li>
                    <li>Grate more parmesan into it, if too liquid</li>
                </ul>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                As the pasta becomes al dente, put it into the pasta strainer. If possible, keep some hot pasta water. 
                <br>
                Turn down the heat for pot and pan and add the pasta to the bacon. Whisk a bit. 
                <br>
                As the temperature of the pan went from medium to low heat, add the egg york and parmesan mixture to the pasta.
                <br>
                <strong>DON'T</strong> add the mixture to the pasta while the pan is still at medium heat. <strong>The egg would curdle!</strong>
                <br>
                Now whisk quickly. Don't keep it on the plate for too long.   
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                You are done. Put it on plates and enjoy. 
                <br> 
                Be aware: Heating this dish in a microwave might make the egg curdle!
